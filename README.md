# Limeade

Ruby interface to the LimeSurvey RemoteControl 2 API

LimeSurvey provides an API for accessing and managing surveys. The current version is RemoteControl 2.
It is exposed as a XML-RPC/JSON-RPC based web service. This gem accesses using JSON-RPC.

The goal of this gem is to access the API in a manner that is natural to rubyists. The API is defined in
terms of methods and arguments. That's easy to mimic in Ruby by means of `#method_missing`. Thus, call any
of the API's methods on the Limeade client itself!

This gem handles the API session transparently so you don't have to even think about it.

> __Note__ that before using the LimeSurvey RemoteControl API you need to activate it for your account. 
See [the manual](https://manual.limesurvey.org/RemoteControl_2_API#How_to_configure_LSRC2) for 
instructions on how to do this. Be sure to choose the **JSON-RPC** option.

> __Note__ also that you must activate a survey in order for it to be visible via the API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'limeade'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install limeade

## Usage

Start by requiring limeade into your code.

``` ruby
require 'limeade'
```

Instantiate a client and start invoking API methods on it. The API methods are documented
 [here](https://api.limesurvey.org/classes/remotecontrol_handle.html). Do not specify the
 `$sSessionKey`, as it is added as the first argument automatically. (Recall that the session is
 managed for you transparently.)
 

```ruby
client = Limeade::Client.new(api_uri, username, password)
surveys = client.list_surveys
summary = client.get_summary(surveys.first['sid'])
```

You'll probably want to get `api_uri`, `username`, and `password` from environment variables.

The responses from the API are parsed from JSON into Ruby objects. Bear in mind that `Hash` keys are
 going to be `String`.

When you are done accessing the API, it is polite to disconnect.
```ruby
client.disconnect
```

### Retry Mechanism

Not every network call goes as planned. Limeade uses the underlying Faraday gem for handling the
transport. Faraday has a retry mechanism,
[Faraday::Request::Retry](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/faraday/0.9.2/Faraday/Request/Retry). Its
behavior is configurable via
[options](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/faraday/0.9.2/Faraday/Request/Retry:initialize) offering a
high degree of control. These same options may be passed when instantiating `Limeade::Client`.

```ruby
client = Limeade::Client.new(api_uri, username, password, max: 5, interval: 1.5)
```

View the `Limeade::Client` documentation for details.

### Logging

The gem defines a logger for its own use. Access it via `Limeade.logger`. Change logging
level like so `Limeade.logger.level = Logger::WARN`

You can substitute your own logger to consolidate logging throughout your app:
```ruby
Limeade.logger = my_apps_logger
```
 
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

The specs rely on API location and credentials being defined as environment variables. Edit `bin/env.sh`
for your situation, then execute it.

    $ source bin/env.sh

Then run the tests.

    $ bundle exec rake spec

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version,
update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create
a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
 [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
